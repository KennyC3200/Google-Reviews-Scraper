# Reviews Scraper
This is a simple script used for the purposes of scraping Google reviews. The reviews are parsed and written into
a JSON file.  I do not plan on maintaining this.

Usage

Dependencies:
* Selenium
* Chromedriver

Install Selenium by running `pip3 install selenium`. Install Chromedriver on their website or on macOS install via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

**Note:** If you are on macOS, after you have installed all of the dependencies, you will have to create a python virtual environment. There are other workarounds for this but this is the easiest way I found to get the dependencies working properly.
